# NFT Wallet for ICP.Ninja: Tax Lien NFTs

## NFT Wallet for ICP.Ninja:

- There are implementations for ICRC-1 tokens at ICP.Ninja, but there is no anything for ICRC-7/NFT, so I decided to make own Implementation of ICRC-7/NFT

## 📜🏠 Tax Lien NFTs

- A **Lien** is a legal right to keep possession of property belonging to another person until a debt owed by that person is discharged.  
- A **Tax Lien** is imposed by law on a property to secure the payment of taxes.
- Tax Lien NFTs gives crypto investor possibility to invest in USA Tax Liens


## 💡 Key Features 

- 🏛️🔗 **Deployer**: Acts as a proxy public company between the **Tax Department** and **Private Crypto Investors**. 
- 💎💰 **NFT Issuance**: On-demand NFTs are issued for investing in any available Tax Lien from the **Tax Department**.
- 🔥💸 **NFT Burn Mechanism**: The NFT can be burned to claim **investments and rewards** ONLY after the **Tax Payer** has paid their debts. 
- 🏡⏳ **Real Estate Claim**: The NFT can also be burned to acquire the **Real Estate property** if the **Tax Payer** fails to pay their debts on time.

## 🛠️ Architecture of Solution 

The solution consists of 6 canisters:
- 📈 **nft_taxlien_backend** - Custom canister for ICRC-7/NFT implementation (based on `icrc7.mo`)
- 🗂️ **business_backend** - Custom canister for business logic, will be parcels database in the future (based on `Hello World` sample)
- 💵 **payment_backend** - Custom canister for payment operations in ICRC-1 (based on `token_transfer_from`)
- 🎉 **nft_taxlien_frontend** - Custom canister for users frontend
- 🚀 **admin_frontend** - Custom canister for admin frontend
- 🔑 **internet_identity** - Standard implementation for authorization
- 📒 **icrc1_ledger_canister** - Standard implementation of ICRC-1 


## 🔄 Canister Interactions
- Canisters can interact with each other
Example canister payment_backend sends command to nft_taxlien_backend for issue NFT after successfull payment
```
    result = await NFTTaxLienBackend.LienMint(memo);
    result = await NFTTaxLienBackend.transfer(memo);
    debug_show(result);
```


## 💡 ICRC-7/NFT implementation (canister nft_taxlien_backend)
- 🔥 Can store and _update_ additional information im memo field using _nfts_update_ 
- 💎 Can use non-standart commands: LienCancel(), LienPay(), LienFail(), LienInvest(), Redeem()
- 🔥 Can use can use standart commands: icrcX_mint(), icrcX_burn()

- Canisters can have some internal logic
Example canister nft_taxlien_backend can use standart Mint(), Burn() commands and non-standart LienCancel, LienPay, LienFail, LienInvest, Redeem
```
  public shared(msg) func LienCancel(token_id : Nat) : async [ICRC7.UpdateNFTResult] {
    //TODO: Change -> Only Deployer
    //Only Deployer
    //if(msg.caller != icrc7().get_state().deployer) D.trap("Unauthorized (only deployer)");

    //TOO: Only status==Pending 

    //TODO: Set status=Cancelled


    switch(icrc7().update_nfts<system>(msg.caller, get_memo(token_id))){
      case(#ok(updateNftResultArray)) updateNftResultArray;
      case(#err(err)) D.trap(err);
    }    
  };
```


* Canister->LienCancel(NFT), Sets Status=Cancelled DeployerOnly
* Canister->LienPay(NFT), ReleaseUSDT, Sets Status-Payed, DeployerOnly
* Canister->LienFail(NFT), ReleaseUSDT, Sets Status=Failed, Payable(GETS USDT), DeployerOnly
* Canister->LienInvest(NFT), Sets Status=Invested, DeployerOnly
* Canister->LienRedeem(

TODO list:
* Statuses of NFT: Pending, Payed, Cancelled, Invested, Redeemed
* After User chose Tax Lien with unique Parcel_Id, that is available in online database, he execute BuyLien smart contract and invest Face_Amount in USDT.
* If Pacrel_Id is unavailable, Deployer runs Cancel(), get Cancelled status. Smart contract send USDT back to payer.
* Deployer gets Parcel_Id and Face_amount. Makes action Pay(), get unblocked USDT to Deployer account.  Making real cash payment to government and waiting for documents. Status changed to Payed.
* On documents received, action Invest()
* If documents not received, sets Cancel()
* On Tax Lien redeem, Deployers sets Redeem(), 
* NFT with Status==Invested can be traded through MarketPlaces

Data Structure:
* State
* County
* Parcel_ID
* Face_Amount
* Property_Amount
* APR
* Issue_Date
* Status

NFT Actions:
* Canister->LienMint (State,County, Parcel_ID, Face_Amount, Property_Amount, APR,Issue_date), Payable(GETS USDT), Makes new NFT, Public, from Mint
* Canister->LienCancel(NFT), Sets Status=Cancelled DeployerOnly
* Canister->LienPay(NFT), ReleaseUSDT, Sets Status-Payed, DeployerOnly
* Canister->LienFail(NFT), ReleaseUSDT, Sets Status=Failed, Payable(GETS USDT), DeployerOnly
* Canister->LienInvest(NFT), Sets Status=Invested, DeployerOnly
* Canister->LienRedeem(NFT), Payable(GETS USDT),Sets Status=Redeemed, Release(USDT to owner), DeployerOnly
* Canister->LienBurn(NFT) Release(USDT to owner), OwnerOnly

USER:
LienMint
LienBurn

ADMIN:
LienCancel
LienPay
LienFail
LienInvest
LienRedeem


Simplifications:
* In this iteration lets say that information (State,County, Parcel_ID, Face_Amount, Property_Amount, APR,Issue_date) will
